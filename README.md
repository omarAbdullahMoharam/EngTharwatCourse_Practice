This repository contains the projects I developed as part of the Flutter beginner course by Eng. Tharwat Samy on Udemy. Each project represents a step in my journey to becoming proficient in Flutter, combining course concepts with my personal touch and challenges.

**1️⃣# Projects Overview**

Below are the projects I completed during the course, displayed with their respective screenshots. Each project helped me understand various aspects of Flutter development such as UI design, state management, animations, and integrations.
